A.	Project Description

  •	Arzoo is augmented reality to overview different animal at zoo using Marker-based AR, and can provide 3d images of different animal. It allows the user to rotate the animal.

B.	Market Analysis

  •	This project will add attraction to those who want to go to the zoo. The zoo management will benefit from this because they will encourage more people to go to the zoo.

C.	Technical Specification

  •	This program will use gitHub to make an WebAR.
