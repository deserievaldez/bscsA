Feasibility Study

ARzoo: An overview of animal at zoo using webAR

A.	Project Description

  •	Arzoo is augmented reality to overview different animal at zoo using Marker-based AR, and can provide 3d images of different animal. It allows the user to rotate the animal.

B.	Market Analysis

  •	This project will add attraction to those who want to go to the zoo. The zoo management will benefit from this because they will encourage more people to go to the zoo.

C.	Technical Specification

  •	This program will use gitHub to make an WebAR.

D.	Risk Analysis

  •	This project will only show 6 different animals

  •	Not exactly the animal in WebAR can be seen in the zoo. The animal 3d images seen on WebAr are just an attraction for more customers.

E.	Describe the possible solutions

•	Book that has different animal

•	WebAR based applications is easy to access when it comes to viewing the overview of the zoo.

F.	Evaluation Criteria

•	Effectiveness – Does the project helps to view different animals?

•	Cost – Does the project cost too much?

•	User Experience – Does the project satisfy the customer?
