# Title: An A.R application that you can play chess vs an A.I
# a.	Project Description- 
Some people enjoy playing chess online or in person, therefore I created AR application where you can play chess alone but compete against an artificial intelligence. Chess is one of the oldest games in history, and people often relate this game to having a higher IQ or more computational power. But even the best chess players in the world are prone to making mistakes and bad emotional decisions. So, are these weaknesses enough to make AI better than humans at chess.
# b.	Market Analysis- 
The target market for this application is those who want to play chess but feel lonely. In this AR application, we improve A.I. to be as intelligent as a person.
# c.	Technical Specification- 
The A.I will respond immediately after you move the pieces. AI can learn the game by playing against itself and studying past games to figure out the best move for any given situation. Because AI doesn't need to relax and doesn't have the same learning limitations as humans, it can complete tasks in chess move more accurately and thoroughly. 
# d.	 Risk Analysis- 
In chess A.I, there is an objective right/wrong. There is always a most accurate move, and there are worse moves. There are better attacks, strategies, positions, tactics, etc. I think you get the point. Chess isn't about “reading people" and countering them based on their decisions. There is no “rock-paper-scissors” in chess, at least in the general sense. It is only now that we are beginning to see what these A.I are capable of.
