# ROOM INSPECTOR

 **Project Description:**

>This program is developed or created in order to help students and teachers to inspect the room using just a photo, it can show in the phone what computer it has, its specification, who is assign to that room, and what room it is for.

>It also helps lessen the human physically input and faster insight to the room.

**Market Analysis:**

>This program helps students and teacher in LSPU Siniloan campus only. It can be access through smartphones only. With the use of this app, we can see basic info of that room also the computer specifications.

**Technical Specification:**

>This program will use WebAr.
  
**Risk Analysis:**
	
>For lacking visible information for the rooms in LSPU Siniloan campus, we have gathered some possible solutions:
1.	Flyer
2.	Pamphlet 
3.	Sticker
4.	Room inspector (our system)

**Describe the possible solutions:**

>Installation of more modem for wider connectivity in the premises or avail a data subscription. Invest in a better phone with better camera or clean the lenses properly.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

>*Low-cost upgrade* - Cheapest upgrade as possible.

>*Internet* – must require 25Mbps upwards on a contact basis for smooth experience, guaranteed to keep up with any new VR developments.

>*Maintainability* – must be easy to evaluate it is important to reduce maintenance cost and improve availability, mainly used to simulate the impact on maintenance operation space.

>*Effectivity* – must determines whether the task can be performed at a practical interval that will either reduce the probability of failure to an acceptable level. And also, the effect must be significantly noticeable.

**Propose with the Feasible Solution:**

>Modem can cost around 2000 pesos, it allows us to have a wider coverage of internet connection, and it can handle more users.

**Conclusion:**

>We conclude that our project can help significantly to those who have unclear sight, they can really zoom in to details. In general, it can help us see the details more clearly and give insight faster than regularly asking the teacher for it.
